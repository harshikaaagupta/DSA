# 🚀 DSA: Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my **DSA journey!** 🌟
This repository is my personal playground where I explore, practice, and conquer **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** — one bug at a time. 🐞➡️💡

---

## 📌 What's inside?

🔹 **Classic Data Structures:**
✅ Arrays
✅ Linked Lists
✅ Stacks & Queues
✅ Trees & Binary Search Trees
✅ Heaps
✅ HashMaps / HashSets
✅ Graphs

🔹 **Algorithmic Goodness:**
✅ Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick...)
✅ Searching (Binary Search and friends)
✅ Recursion & Backtracking
✅ Dynamic Programming
✅ Greedy Algorithms
✅ Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra...)

---

## 💻 Language(s)

✨ Mostly **Java** (because I love its structure!)
✨ Sometimes C++ / Python for variety

---

## 🚀 Why this repo?

Because **DSA is the gym for your brain** 🧠💪
I solve problems, make notes, and share my code to:
📌 Track my learning progress
📌 Help others who are on the same path
📌 Build muscle memory for coding interviews

---

## 🤹 Fun facts

💡 Sometimes my code works on the first try.
💡 Sometimes my code teaches me patience.
💡 Always, my code helps me grow!
