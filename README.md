Got it 👍 Since your repo uses **only Java**, I’ll refine the README to reflect that clearly and make it more professional:

# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Repository

Welcome to my **DSA repository** — a curated collection of problems, solutions, and notes on **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**.
This repository is my personal journey to strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare for **coding interviews** and **competitive programming**.

---

## 📌 Contents

### 🔹 **Data Structures**

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Trees & Binary Search Trees
* Heaps & Priority Queues
* Hashing (HashMap / HashSet)
* Graphs

### 🔹 **Algorithms**

* Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.)
* Searching (Binary Search and variations)
* Recursion & Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming (DP)
* Greedy Algorithms
* Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim, etc.)

---

## 💻 Language Used

* **Java** (all implementations are written in Java)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Strengthen **DSA fundamentals** through hands-on coding
* Build a **strong foundation** for coding interviews
* Maintain a **structured collection** of Java-based DSA solutions
* Share knowledge and resources with fellow learners
